						Transformer Oils are electrical insulating oils produced by distillation of virgin paraffinic and naphthenic crude oils followed by modern technologies involving high pressure hydrogenation and hydro-treatment. All the processes are monitored closely and appropriate Base Oil fractions are selected for further processing. Further processing involves removal of moisture and polar impurities to obtain good electrical properties. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The technologies result in products with very low pour point, excellent oxidation stability, cooling characteristics and electrical properties. These properties make them suitable for the most demanding transformer applications.
